# Iris-datasets-machine-learning 
# Python3 using scikit learn library and Jupiter Notebook 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:- We are going to perform machine learning algorithm on iris datasets to classify three different type of species ("setosa" as 0, "versicolor" as 1, "verginica" as 2).In this datsets there are four features sepal length,sepal width,petal length,petal width.This is supervised learning algorithm because output is given along the data.
